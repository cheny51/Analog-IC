# Analog-IC
### Description
The modeling, analysis, and design of analog integrated circuits using CMOS technology. Topics include basic integrated circuit components, basic amplifier stages, operational amplifiers, frequency compensation and stability, and bandgap references. Emphasis is placed on the design of the fundamental circuits required for analog signal processing.
### What does this repository contain?
1. Code to show MOSFET analysis.
2. Code to plot MOSFET IV characteristics
3. (eventually) documentation of ASP design.
